# Manifold Plugin

## Overview
Manifold protocol is a comprehensive NFT toolkit designed to empower digital creators by restoring their complete control over NFTs.

### Mint Action

The manifold plugin targets both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 mints. Both types use identical ABI. The main difference is that the tokenId/instanceId is not relevant to our plugin filter.

#### Sample Transactions

There are 2 types of mints we see on the Manifold contracts
- [ERC-721](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xc5c5429a7b6f52fe0d151882a592a40eb9c8ca7d0b14c415a51b960ca13cc7f4)
- [ERC-1155](https://basescan.org/tx/0xe20f869064bdda5b6f0d730541d5ddfe3d572516c872440fd642dbff9e53ab7f)
