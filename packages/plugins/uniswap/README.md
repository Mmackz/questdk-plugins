# Uniswap Plugin

## Overview
Uniswap is a popular dex that is deployed on several EVM networks. The uniswap plugin filters swap transactions made on uniswap through the [universal router](https://github.com/Uniswap/universal-router) contract.

## Features
- **Network Support:** Compatible with all Uniswap-supported networks.
- **Uniswap V2 and V3:** Full compatibility with Uniswap V2 and V3.
- **Updated Integration:** Uses Uniswap SDKs for up-to-date features.

## Limitations
- There should be no limitations with the current swap plugin. Everything should work as expected.

## Sample Transactions
- [V2 Swap](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8bcf17ad4841ccaff29f1437dd63239df7c07408a31fc826cd300356b78ef718)
