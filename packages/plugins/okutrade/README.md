# Oku Trade Swap Plugin

This plugin is designed to filter valid swap transactions made using Oku Trade. Oku Trade is a trader-cetric frontend for uniswap, which offers enhanced analaytics and charts.

## Overview

The Oku Trade plugin is based off our uniswap plugin, as they both use uniswaps universal router contracts. The main differences between the two plugins are:

- Oku Trade utilizes the pre-migrated versions of the universal router contracts, so the addresses are different.
- Sightly different list of supported networks. OkuTrade works on zkSync, but does not have support for avalance or base.
